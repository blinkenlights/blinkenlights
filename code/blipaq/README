BlinkenIPAQ - a simple Blinkenlights Movie Viewer for the iPaq
--------------------------------------------------------------

If you have no clue what Blinkenlights is, take a look at
http://www.blinkenlights.de/ first.

This is a simple Blinkenlights movie viewer designed to be used on an
iPaq or any other handheld device with a color screen of at least
240x320 pixels. It also works on a PC, but the resolution is fixed to
the small screen size of the iPaq.


Requirements
------------

blipaq uses DirectFB to draw on the Linux framebuffer. You will need a
recent version of DirectFB (>= 0.9.11) installed with header files to
compile BlinkenSim. DirectFB is available from http://www.directfb.org/.

You also need pkg-config, a small utility that helps to locate
installed software such as DirectFB. pkg-config is available from
http://www.freedesktop.org/software/pkgconfig/.


Installation
------------

Change to the toplevel source directory and type

  ./configure

You can pass the usual options to configure (try ./configure --help).
Additionally you should specify the default screen rotation needed for
your framebuffer:

 --enable-rotatation=left   should work for older iPaqs
 --enable-rotatation=right  should work for newer iPaqs
 --enable-rotatation=none   is what you want to use for your PC

Then type

  make
  make install

This should build and install blipaq for you. Make sure your
framebuffer is configured correctly for DirectFB. Please check the
DirectFB FAQ if you encounter problems.


Usage
-----

Just start blipaq passing it the filename of a Blinkenlights movie:

 blipaq [options] <moviefile>

You can pass the usual options supported by all DirectFB apps (use
--dfb-help to get a list of these options). Additionally you can
choose the screen rotation if you need a different setting than
the default specified at compile time:

 blipaq --rotate [left|right|none] <moviefile>

When running blipaq can be controlled using the PC keyboard or the
iPaq buttons:

 Right            next frame
 Left             previous frame
 Up, Down, Space  toggle Play/Pause
 Esc, Q           quit blipaq
