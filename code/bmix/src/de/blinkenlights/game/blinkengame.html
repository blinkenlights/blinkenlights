	<h1>Blinkengame API for Java</h1>
	
	<p>Writing games in Java that work with Blinkenlights is easy! To get started:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Ensure you have a <a href="http://java.sun.com/">JDK installed</a> (requires
		Sun JDK5.0 or newer)</li>
		<li>Download the <a href="blinkengame_sdk.zip">blinkengame development kit</a> and unzip it</li>
		<li>Open a terminal window and try compiling the example game:<br>
			<tt>% javac -cp blinkengame.jar ExampleGame.java</tt><br>
 			then run it like this:<br>
			<tt>% java -cp blinkengame.jar:. ExampleGame</tt><br>
			(on windows, substitute a semilcolon for the colon).</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>That's it. Now just make a copy of ExampleGame.java, and modify to your heart's
	content.</p>
	
	
	<h2>How it Works</h2>
	
	<p>Take a look at the example game's source code, <a href="ExampleGame.java">ExampleGame.java</a>.</p>
		It's an implementation of the <a href="javadoc/de/blinkenlights/game/BlinkenGame.html">BlinkenGame</a>
		interface, which has three methods: <tt>gameStarting()</tt>,
		<tt>nextFrame()</tt>, and <tt>gameEnding()</tt>. Let's look at each of them in turn, using
		excerpts from the example game:</p>
		
	<pre>
	public void gameStarting(GameContext gameContext) {
        System.out.println("Game starting");
        context = gameContext;
        centre = gameContext.getPlayfieldWidth() / 2;
        xOffset = 0;
    }
	</pre>
	
	<p>This method is called once when the game is starting. The game will start
		due to some user input: on the simulator, you press the "Start Call" button,
		and in the real installation, the game will start when someone calls the
		designated telephone number for your game.</p>
		
	<p>The game context parameter contains useful information such as playfield dimensions,
		frame rate, and so on. You will probably find it handy to stash a reference to
		it like this example does.</p>
	
	<p>The println is just for your use as a developer. It will show up in your console
		when the game starts. Println output will not be visible to players of the real game.</p>
		
	<p>Now the nextFrame() method. This is where you put the meat of your game.</p>
	
	<pre>
    public boolean nextFrame(Graphics2D g, FrameInfo frameInfo) {
        
        System.out.println("Frame@" + frameInfo.getWhen() + "ms. User Input="+frameInfo.getUserInput());
        Character input = frameInfo.getUserInput();
        if (input != null) {
            xOffset++;
        }
        if (xOffset * 2 &gt;= context.getPlayfieldWidth()) {
            xOffset = 0;
        }
        
        int height = context.getPlayfieldHeight();
        g.setColor(Color.WHITE);
        g.drawLine(centre - xOffset, 0, centre - xOffset, height);
        g.drawLine(centre + xOffset, 0, centre + xOffset, height);
        
        // quit after 60 seconds so people can't hog it
        return frameInfo.getWhen() &lt; 60000;
    }
    </pre>
    
    <p>This example isn't really a game at all. It simply draws a couple of vertical
    	lines that move apart every time the user presses a button on their phone.</p>
    
    <p>The useful lessons here are:
    <ul>
    	<li>frameInfo.getUserInput() is the way to find out if the user has pressed
    		a button on their phone. If the user hasn't pressed anything since last
    		time you checked,  frameInfo.getUserInput() returns null.</li>
    	<li>You return true from nextFrame() if you want the game to keep going. When
    		you return false, the game is over. This game uses that strategy together
    		with the information about how many milliseconds the game has been running
    		in order to implement a 1-minute (60000ms) time limit.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>And finally, the gameEnding() method:</p>
    
    <pre>
    public void gameEnding(Graphics2D g) {
        System.out.println("Game ending");
        g.drawLine(0, 0, context.getPlayfieldWidth(), context.getPlayfieldHeight());
        context = null;
        xOffset = 0;
        centre = 0;
    }
    </pre>
    
    <p>This method is guaranteed to be called some time after gameStarting() has been called.
    	Once it has been called, there will be no further calls to nextFrame() until
    	gameStarting() has been called again.
    	
    <p>You can use it to paint a final frame for your game. In this case, we just draw
    	a diagonal line from top left to bottom right. If you want to play an animated
    	ending sequence, you will have to keep track of your game state and do the ending
    	sequence in nextFrame().</p>
    	
    <p>You can also clean up any resources you allocated in gameStarted() or while
    	the game was in play. In this case, there's nothing that really needs cleanup,
    	but we're clearing our reference to the game context and zeroing out the
    	information about playfield size just to be polite.</p>
    
    <h3>Test playing</h3>
    
    <p>The example game also has a main method:</p>
    <pre>
    public static void main(String[] args) throws GameConfigurationException {
        BlinkenGame game = new ExampleGame();
        GameContext context = new GameContext(game);
        context.start();
    }
	</pre>
	
	<p>This is just a simple way to launch your game for testing. In the real scenario, your
		main method will not be called. Put any initialization you need into either your class's
		no-args constructor or in your startGame() method.</p>
	
	
	<h2>Formal Documentation</h2>
	
	<p>The javadoc for the blinkengame library
	   <a href="javadoc/de/blinkenlights/game/package-summary.html">is here</a>.</p> 
	
	
	<h2>Other APIs</h2>
	
	<p>Dan Fraser and Robin Senior have created a similar system that uses
		the Processing language. If you don't already have a Java development
		infrastructure set up, you will find it much quicker to start with
		Processing.</p>
		
	<p>You can find it on <a href="http://robinsenior.com/blinkenlights">Robin's
		site</a>.</p>
		
	<p>If you just want to make static movies, one option is to use
		<a href="http://capybara.org/~dfraser/?p=261">Dan Fraser's
		ImageToBML program</a>. It converts a directory full of images into a BML
		movie file.</p>
