BMix Notes

==StatsClient To do==
* make a game loop
* outputs should have names
* use dashed line and change phase when packets received
* generate OIDs for each real object that is the subject of bmix statistics
* stats should send number of frame since last update
* better startup - bullet-proofingness
* pack the frame after getting data
* represet relay senders as separate boxes

===v1.2===
* more status messages on debug
* multi-screen multiframe packet sending
* config reload

==Future Features==

* "live" reconfigure without restart
* configuration for chroma key color

==Other/Infrastructure== 

* Check all code with Findbugs!
