BMix Notes

==To do==

* figure how to properly configure logging
* figure out how to (almost) never drop a packet
* add magic command line arguments
** disable gui
** adjust output verbosity
* max framerate
* stop frames (waiting for more spec)
* lamp gamma (optional)
* input relay
* configuration for chroma key color

==Listeners==

* receives data from blccc
* listen port
* relay destination ip / port (multiple)
* idle timeout to mark input stream as invalid
* stop frame would cause instant "idle" timeout

==Mixer==

* handles compositing of layers
* handles application of compositing rules
* master timing

===Layers===

* input/listener
* viewport on virutal buffer
* opacity
* scale (normally 1:1)
* key colour
* z order
* compositing rule

==Outputs==

* destination ip / port (multiple)
* virtual buffer viewport
** pixels outside virtual buffer are black
* lamp gamma (optional)
* max/min frame rate
* blackout/freeze/disable
