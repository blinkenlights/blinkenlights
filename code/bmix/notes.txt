BMix Notes

==StatsClient To do==
* turn layout so inputs are at top instead of left
** put preview frame above text in layer label
** show tree structure in multiple layer columns
* make it restartable when bmix closes (UDP? catch and retry?)
* get rid of HTML (use statbox subclasses with individual layouts)
* fix background layer framerate lie (it appears to get a new frame constantly, even if there is no input activity)
* render vmatrix
* show output and input viewports over vmatrix
* visualize inputs that are timed out
* outputs should have names
* draw arrows down the layer stack?
* generate OIDs for each real object that is the subject of bmix statistics
* better startup - bullet-proofingness
* represent relay senders as separate boxes

===Done===
* centre columns vertically
* render input graphics on each layer infobox


===v1.3===
* new config and runtime statistics network protocol with GUI client. features include:
** 
* configurable chroma key color (default is still black)
* shadow mode on each input to allow background layer to partially show through the transparent parts

===v1.2===
* more status messages on debug
* multi-screen multiframe packet sending
* config reload

==Future Features==

* "live" reconfigure without restart

==Other/Infrastructure== 

* Check all code with Findbugs!
