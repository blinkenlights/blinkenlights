BMix Notes

==StatsClient To do==
* (bmix) maintain order of inputs and outputs when parsing bmix.xml, then ensure order is carried through to stats
* centre columns vertically
* render input graphics on each input infobox
* render vmatrix
* show output and input viewports over vmatrix
* outputs should have names
* draw arrows down the layer stack?
* generate OIDs for each real object that is the subject of bmix statistics
* better startup - bullet-proofingness
* pack the frame after getting data
* represet relay senders as separate boxes

===v1.3===
* new config and runtime statistics network protocol with GUI client. features include:
** 
* configurable chroma key color (default is still black)
* shadow mode on each input to allow background layer to partially show through the transparent parts

===v1.2===
* more status messages on debug
* multi-screen multiframe packet sending
* config reload

==Future Features==

* "live" reconfigure without restart

==Other/Infrastructure==
