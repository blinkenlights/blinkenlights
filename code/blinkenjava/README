To build blinkenjava you must have a JDK 1.3.x installed. Specify it during
configure time with --with-jdk. Of course you will need the blinkenlights
library (blib), . Don't forget to make sure that pkg-config will find the
configuration files for blib, so usually you will have to add s.th. like
/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig to your PKG_CONFIG_PATH, if you configured 'blib' with
"--prefix=/usr/local" (or with nothing, as this is the default)

# ./autogen.sh --with-jdk=/your/path/to/jdk1.3.x

followed by 

# make; make install

and maybe

# make javadoc

(This will build java docmentation into build/dist)

The Blinkenjava module will install itself into the
blib-modules-directory. To use it, you will add some path to
your LD_LIBRARY_PATH, the output of autogen.sh will show you what
exactly you will need. if you didn't specify an VM type explicitly
(using --with-vm=[client|server|classic]), these are:

JDK_HOME/jre/lib/i386
JDK_HOME/jre/lib/i386/client
JDK_HOME/jre/lib/i386/native_threads

To try it, do the following (assuming blib installed itself in
/usr/local/lib/blib-1.0):

Start your blinkensim or whatever you do to watch the output.

# cd BLIB_SRC_HOME/test 
# ./test-module /usr/local/lib/blib-1.0 Blinkenjava <hostname> \
#      --property:class=<fully qualified classname of blinkenlet>

Try "de.blinkenlights.examples.Blinkenlife": this should fire up a game of life
on the display.

Alternatively, install "test-module" somewhere in your path
and call 
# test-blinkenlet <classname> <hostname>

CLASSPATH: Usually you will not need to set a classpath. Blinkenjava will
install its own classes as a file "blinken.jar" in directory
$BLIB_DATADIR/classes (e.g.  /usr/local/share/blib-1.0/classes/blinken.jar).
When the module is initialized it will print to stdout where it will search the
classes.  Additionally, you can set a CLASSPATH. It will be evaluated and takes
precedence over the builtin path. (This concept might need to change, when we
add jars provided by blinkenlet coders, so they can not replace the
original blinkenlet classes). If you provide you own blinkenlet, simply put
them in the classpath.

Note:
- tested with SUN JDK 1.3 (and quickly with JDK1.4.1)
- uses 1.2 JNI features, so will not work with 1.1
- we got problems using IBMs JDK ...
