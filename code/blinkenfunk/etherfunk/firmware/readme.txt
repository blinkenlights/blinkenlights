The contained firmware source code is verified to compile flawless by using
GCC version 4.0.2 configured as ARM cross compiler.

The USB device creates a virtual serial COM port - you can access it by using
115200 baud, 8 data bit, no parity and one stop bit. Under Linux just plug it
into your computer - a /dev/ttyACM? device will appear automagically.

We personally prefer the "cu" command line tool from uucp-Package to access
the created serial port easily under Linux based operating systems.

For Microsoft Windows you have to use the supplied .inf-file from the
"win32driver" directory - you can verify the assigned COM port by using the
control panel.

Use the contained "at91flash"-tool to udpate to contained firmware. The
supplied script depends on our modified sam7 tool:

Enjoy !
