Gondwana - a quick hack for a bushfire simulator


Requirements
------------

Gonwana uses DirectFB to draw on the Linux framebuffer. You will need
a recent version of DirectFB (>= 0.9.11) installed with header files
to compile BlinkenSim.  DirectFB is available from
http://www.directfb.org/.

You also need pkg-config, a small utility that helps to locate
installed software such as DirectFB. pkg-config is available from
http://www.freedesktop.org/software/pkgconfig/.


Installation
------------

Change to the toplevel source directory and type

  ./configure
  make
  make install

You can pass the usual options to configure (try ./configure --help).
This should build and install blinkensim for you. Make sure your 
framebuffer is configured correctly for DirectFB. Please check the 
DirectFB FAQ for information.


Usage
-----

Usage is very simple, just start it. There are no command-line
parameters but the ones supported by all DirectFB apps (use --dfb-help
to get a list of these options).

Note that you need to have root privileges in order to access the
framebuffer and to switch terminals. You might consider installing
blinkensim suid root.


Have Blinkenfun,
