windowmatrixd
-------------

For building the windowmatrixd, configure it using the configure shell
script. You have to specify the path to the bmc_pio driver buildtree
to allow for configure to find the driver's include file
bmc_pio.h. For help on using a configure script, see the file
INSTALL.generic in this directory.

Additional compile-time configuration can be done via editing
the config.h header file, it should be self-explanatory.

After configuring the package, you can compile it using

make

and then install it using

make install
