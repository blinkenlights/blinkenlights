bmc_pio - BMC PIO card driver for Linux 2.2

BUILDING
  To build the driver:
   make KINC=<path-to-your-kernel-includes>
  After compiling, you should create the device
  special files for the driver. This can be done
  using MakeDev.sh .

IOCTLS
  * BMC_PIO_CTL_DIRECTION
    Sets the I/O direction for the port operated on.
    The argument is a char and stands for the direction:
     BMC_PIO_INPUT sets the port to input mode
     BMC_PIO_OUTPUT sets the port to output mode

  * BMC_PIO_CTL_SETMODE_A/BMC_PIO_CTL_SETMODE_B
      "This ioctl fixes the status
     of the portgroup on your apparatus
     which is the chip that controls
     the device of your goals
     as it's addressed by the illuminatus."
                         Tina and Packet

     Sets the mode of group A/B of the chip the port operated
     on is part of.
     For group A there are 3 possible modes:
     * BMC_PIO_GROUPA_M0
       Sets group A to generic I/O mode.
     * BMC_PIO_GROUPA_M1
       Sets group A to strobed I/O mode.
     * BMC_PIO_GROUPA_M2
       Sets group A to bidirectional I/O mode.
       for group B, only mode 0 and 1 are allowed:
     * BMC_PIO_GROUPB_M0
       Sets group B to generic I/O mode.
     * BMC_PIO_GROUPB_M1
       Sets group B to strobed I/O mode.
